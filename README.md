# T-Mobile-Hacktober

Hello Judges,

Thank you so much for taking the time to look at T-CoMo!

After a lot of research, we found out that one of the biggest threats on the internet is the lack of awareness of how websites and softwares can track our personal information and even use it to make money. For this reason, we decided to create a project that would tackle this issue and give users their right to control their personal information by giving them the awareness of their information that is being tracked.

T-CoMo stands for T-Cookie Monster. This is a browser extension that live scans the webpages a user is on and it records the cookies on those pages.
From there, it takes those cookies and displays them on a personalized dashboard for the user. From there, they can see what cookies are tracking them and their personal information. 

In order to open this extension, you will need to clone the files to your text-editor (or if you prefer: download the code as a ZIP File). Then go to chrome://extensions and activate the developer mode. From there, you will need to unload the T-Como folder and it should activate the extension. 

If this does not work, you can access the browser version of the extension through the file "popup.html", simply right-click and hit "open as browser" and you should be able to view the extension.

We hope you have a wonderful day!

T-CoMo Team
